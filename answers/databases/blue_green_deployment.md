# What is Blue-Green Deployment and how does it affect database changes?

**Blue-Green Deployment** is a deployment strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments (Blue and Green). At any time, only one environment is live. New versions are deployed to the idle environment, tested, and then traffic is switched over. If issues arise, rollback is as simple as switching back to the previous environment.

## How Blue-Green Deployment Works
1. **Blue** is the current live environment; **Green** is idle (or vice versa).
2. Deploy the new application version to Green.
3. Run tests and smoke checks on Green.
4. Switch traffic from Blue to Green (DNS, load balancer, etc.).
5. If problems occur, switch back to Blue.

## Complications with Database Changes
- **Stateless vs. Stateful:** Blue-Green works best for stateless services. Databases are stateful, so changes must be carefully managed.
- **Schema Changes:** If the new version requires database schema changes, both Blue and Green must be compatible with the schema during the transition.
- **Data Migration:** Data written by the new version (Green) may not be compatible with the old version (Blue) if a rollback is needed.
- **Split-Brain Risk:** If both environments write to the database at the same time, data consistency issues can occur.

## Best Practices for Database Changes in Blue-Green Deployment
- **Backward-Compatible Migrations:** Make schema changes in a way that both old and new application versions can work with the database (e.g., add columns, avoid dropping or renaming fields immediately).
- **Two-Step Deployments:**
  1. Deploy schema changes that are backward compatible.
  2. Deploy application changes that use the new schema.
- **Feature Toggles:** Use feature flags to control access to new features until the migration is complete.
- **Data Migration Scripts:** Run data migrations as separate, monitored steps.
- **Read-Only Mode:** Temporarily set the database to read-only during the switchover to prevent data loss.
- **Rollback Plan:** Ensure you can roll back both application and database changes if needed.

## When to Avoid Blue-Green for Databases
- When schema changes are not backward compatible.
- When data migrations are large and cannot be completed quickly.
- When the risk of data loss or inconsistency is high.
