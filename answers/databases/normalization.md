# Is it always needed to use database normalization? When is it advisable to use denormalized databases?

**Database normalization** is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. While normalization (typically up to 3NF or BCNF) is a best practice for transactional systems, there are scenarios where denormalization is beneficial.

## When to Use Normalization
- **Transactional (OLTP) Systems:** Ensures data consistency, avoids duplication, and simplifies updates.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforces referential integrity and reduces anomalies (update, insert, delete anomalies).
- **Complex Relationships:** When data has many-to-many or hierarchical relationships.

## When to Use Denormalization
- **Performance Optimization:** For read-heavy workloads, denormalization can reduce the number of joins and improve query speed.
- **Analytical (OLAP) Systems:** Data warehouses and reporting systems often use denormalized schemas (e.g., star or snowflake schema) for faster aggregations.
- **Caching and Precomputed Results:** When you need to serve data quickly and can tolerate some redundancy.
- **NoSQL Databases:** Many NoSQL systems encourage denormalization for scalability and performance.

## Trade-offs
- **Normalization:**
  - Pros: Data integrity, easier updates, less redundancy.
  - Cons: More complex queries (more joins), potential performance issues for large-scale reads.
- **Denormalization:**
  - Pros: Faster reads, simpler queries for reporting/analytics.
  - Cons: Data redundancy, risk of inconsistency, more complex updates.

## Best Practices
- Normalize by default for transactional systems.
- Denormalize selectively for performance, but document and automate consistency checks.
- Use materialized views or caching for expensive aggregations.
- Regularly review schema as application needs evolve.
