# These are not Absolute Answers.

I am just going to keep adding the answers as I learn them here. These are not the absolute solutions to these question, these are more like what the industry accepts as the answer to these questions Today. They might change in future. But until they do, take these with a bit of salt </br>.

I am just gonna add them for myself. If anyone wants to contribute to answer any questions, you are more than welcome (cause I can't possibly find all the answers).
