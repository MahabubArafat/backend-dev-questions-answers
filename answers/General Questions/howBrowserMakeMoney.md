## How do web browsers make money?

- `Search royalties`: Search engine companies make partnerships with browsers companies to have them as the default search engine. The search engine generates revenue (through ads and sponsored results) from search and capturing the users of the browser. A percentage of the revenue generated (referred to as royalties) is paid to the browser company. For example, Google pays Mozilla royalties every year in order to be the default search engine in Firefox. In 2021, Google paid Mozilla $527 million (87.8% of Mozilla's total revenue).

  Google Chrome browser, Google earns money from ads but since they own the browser, it saves them from paying royalties to other web browsers. Instead, the money is just transferred to the Chrome part of Google.

- `Advertising`: Some web browsers, such as Opera and Brave offer their own advertising programs that allow users to opt-in and create their Ad campaigns, earning them advertising revenue.

- `Donations`: Some browsers earn an income through contributions by donors. For example, Firefox is funded by the Mozilla Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that earns its money through donations.
- `Premium features`: Some web browsers offer premium features for a fee. For example, the Vivaldi browser offers features such as custom themes, mouse gestures, and tab stacking for a one-time payment.
- `Licensing`: Some web browsers are pre-installed on new computers and mobile devices, where the manufacturers pay a fee to the browser company for the licensing rights.
- `Indirect market penetration`: Since the web browser is the primary way of accessing the Internet, companies that own browsers and have other sources of revenue on the internet can easily push their other products to the existing browser users. For instance, for Google, having people using Chrome is crucial to promoting their other products such as Gmail, Google search, Google Docs, Google Drive, etc.
- `Data collection`: Ads are most profitable when you have as much data as possible for the people you are showing them to. Google generates most of its income from advertising. Chrome helps collect user data to improve their advertising and show more targeted ads which results in increased conversions and revenue.
- `Commissions from extensions`: Most web browsers allow the installation of extensions that add more functionalities. Some of those extensions require payment to use. In such cases, the browsers take a percentage of the amount charged as a commission.
