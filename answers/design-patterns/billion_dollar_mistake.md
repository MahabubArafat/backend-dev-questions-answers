# The Billion Dollar Mistake: How to avoid null reference errors

The **"Billion Dollar Mistake"** refers to the invention of the null reference by Tony Hoare, which has led to countless bugs, crashes, and security issues in software. Modern best practices and language features help avoid null-related problems.

---

## Why is null a problem?
- **Null references** represent the absence of a value, but using them can lead to:
  - Null pointer exceptions (runtime crashes)
  - Hidden bugs and hard-to-trace errors
  - Security vulnerabilities

## Techniques to Avoid Null Reference Errors

### 1. **Null Object Pattern**
- Use a special object that implements the expected interface but does nothing (or returns safe defaults).
- Avoids the need for null checks in client code.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  class NullLogger:
      def log(self, message):
          pass  # Do nothing
  
  logger = get_logger() or NullLogger()
  logger.log("message")  # Safe, even if no real logger
  ```

### 2. **Option/Maybe Types**
- Use types that explicitly represent the presence or absence of a value (e.g., `Option` in Scala, `Optional` in Java, `Maybe` in Haskell).
- Forces the developer to handle the "none" case explicitly.
- **Example (Python 3.10+):**
  ```python
  from typing import Optional
  def find_user(id: int) -> Optional[User]:
      ...
  user = find_user(1)
  if user is not None:
      ...
  ```

### 3. **Non-nullable Types**
- Some languages (e.g., Kotlin, Swift, TypeScript with `strictNullChecks`) distinguish between nullable and non-nullable types at compile time.
- Nulls are only allowed where explicitly permitted.

### 4. **Fail Fast and Defensive Programming**
- Validate inputs and fail early if nulls are not allowed.
- Use assertions or exceptions to catch nulls at boundaries.

## Best Practices
- Prefer non-nullable types by default.
- Use Option/Maybe/Optional types for values that may be absent.
- Apply the Null Object Pattern for polymorphic interfaces.
- Avoid returning null from functions; return an empty collection or Option type instead.
