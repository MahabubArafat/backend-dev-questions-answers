Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning system that uses a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format, where updates increment:

* **MAJOR** for breaking changes, **MINOR** for backward-compatible new features, and **PATCH** for bug fixes.

This helps developers understand the impact of updates and manage dependencies more reliably.

For example, version `2.3.1` means:

* The package has **major** changes in version 2, **minor** improvements or new features in version 3, and **patch** fixes in version 1.
