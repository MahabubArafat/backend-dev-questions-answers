# What are the limits and pitfalls of the Active Record pattern?

The **Active Record** pattern is a popular approach in ORMs where an object wraps a row in a database table and exposes methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). While simple and convenient, it has several limitations and pitfalls, especially as applications grow in complexity.

---

## Advantages
- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and use for basic CRUD operations.
- **Rapid Development:** Reduces boilerplate code for simple data access.
- **Good for Small Apps:** Works well for applications with simple domain logic.

---

## Limits and Pitfalls
- **Mixes Concerns:** Combines persistence logic with business/domain logic, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Difficult to Test:** Business logic is tightly coupled to the database, making unit testing harder.
- **Poor Fit for Complex Domains:** As domain logic grows, Active Record objects become bloated and hard to maintain.
- **Hard to Decouple:** Difficult to swap out the persistence layer or use different storage backends.
- **Transaction Management:** Managing complex transactions across multiple records can be error-prone.
- **Scaling Issues:** Not ideal for large-scale or highly concurrent systems.

## Example (Pseudo-code)
```python
class User(Model):  # Active Record base class
    def deactivate(self):
        self.active = False
        self.save()  # Directly persists to DB
```
- Here, `User` contains both business logic (`deactivate`) and persistence logic (`save`).

---

## When to Use
- Small to medium-sized applications.
- Simple CRUD-based systems.
- Prototyping or rapid development.

## When to Avoid
- Large, complex domains with rich business logic.
- Systems requiring strict separation of concerns.
- Applications needing flexible or pluggable persistence layers.
