# Why do many software engineers not like Java?

## ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)
Imagine you have a toy that works really well, but it’s big, heavy, and takes a long time to start. Some people love it, but others wish it was lighter and faster. That’s how some programmers feel about Java!

## Common Reasons for Disliking Java
- **Verbosity:** Java code can be long and repetitive (lots of boilerplate).
- **Slow Startup:** Java programs can take longer to start compared to native apps.
- **Memory Usage:** Java apps can use more memory than programs written in C or Go.
- **Old-fashioned Syntax:** Some find Java’s syntax less modern than newer languages (e.g., Python, Kotlin).
- **Enterprise Baggage:** Java is associated with big, slow-moving enterprise projects.
- **Checked Exceptions:** Some dislike Java’s checked exception system.

## Example (Verbosity)
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
- Compare to Python: `print("Hello, world!")`

## But Java Has Strengths Too!
- Huge ecosystem, great performance for large systems, cross-platform, strong typing, and more.
