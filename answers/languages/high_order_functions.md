# Higher-Order Functions: What are they and what are they useful for?

## ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)
Imagine you have a robot that can build other robots. A higher-order function is like that robotâ€”it can take other functions as input or give you new functions as output!

## What is a Higher-Order Function?
- A function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as a result.
- Useful for customizing behavior, code reuse, and functional programming.

---

## Example (Python)
```python
def apply_twice(func, value):
    return func(func(value))

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

print(apply_twice(add_one, 3))  # 5
```
- `apply_twice` takes a function and a value, and applies the function twice.

---

## Why Use Higher-Order Functions?
- **Reusability:** Write flexible, reusable code.
- **Abstraction:** Hide details and focus on what needs to be done.
- **Functional Programming:** Enables map, filter, reduce, etc.
