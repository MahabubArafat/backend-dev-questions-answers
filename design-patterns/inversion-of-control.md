### Relation with Hollywood Principle
For some the Hollywood Principle (or Law) is just a synonym of Inversion of Control; some others see subtle differences. See  [Confusion between Inversion of Control and Hollywood Principle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43786221/confusion-between-inversion-of-control-and-hollywood-principle).

In this context, another related topic is the difference between libraries and frameworks, as it is stated that frameworks follow the Hollywood Principle (see [What is the difference between a framework and a library?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library)).
